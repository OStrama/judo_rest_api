## Installation

### HACS (manually add Repository)

Add this repository to HACS.
* In the HACS GUI, select "Custom repositories"
* Enter the following repository URL: https://github.com/OStrama/judo_rest_api
* Category: Integration
* After adding the integration, restart Home Assistant.
* Now press the button "Add Integration" in Configuration -> Integrations to install it in Home assistant.
* Now under Configuration -> Integrations, "Judo REST API" should be available.

### Manual install

Create a directory called `judo_rest_api` in the `<config directory>/custom_components/` directory on your Home Assistant
instance. Install this component by copying all files in `/custom_components/judo_rest_api/` folder from this repo into the
new `<config directory>/custom_components/judo_rest_api/` directory you just created.

This is how your custom_components directory should look like:

```bash
custom_components
├── judo_rest_api
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
│   └── sensor.py  
```
## Configuration

The only mandatory parameters are:
* The IP-Address of your Judo water treatment device. The port should be ok at default (80) unless you changed it in the configuration of the connectivity module.
* The user name. The default value of the connectivity module is "admin". You can change it on the web interface of the connectivity module
* The password. The default value of the connectivity module is "Connectivity". You can change it on the web interface of the connectivity module

The "Device Postfix" has a default value of "". It can be used to add multiple devices to one home assistant. For compatibility this should be left empty. If you want to add another device, use a name that helps to identify the devices.
The "Scan interval" determines how often the REST API is polled. The default value is every 60 seconds. Too small values will cause more timeouts.
